# UML-State-Diagrams

### Introduction
In the Unified Modeling Language (UML), a state machine diagram models
the behaviour of a single object, specifying the sequence of events that an
object goes through during its lifetime in response to events. The primary
focus of the state machine diagram is to depict the states of a system. These
states are essential while drawing a state transition diagram.

### State Machine Elements:
○ **States:** States represent the conditions or situations that a system can
be in at any given time. It is denoted by a round-cornered rectangle.
○ **Transitions:** Transitions represent the changes from one state to another
in response to an input. It are denoted by lines with arrowheads.
○ **Inputs:** Inputs represent the events or conditions that trigger a transition
from one state to another.
○ **Decision box:** Outputs represent the actions or results that occur when
a transition is made.
○ **Initial State:** the system starts before any inputs are received, it is
denoted by a filled black circle.
○ **Final State:** the system transitions to when it has completed its task. It is
denoted by a circle with a dot inside.

### UML State machine diagram is used for:
○ modelling the object states of a system
○ pinpointing the events responsible for state transitions
○ Specifying the context and requirements of a system
○ Modeling the basic flow of events in a use case
